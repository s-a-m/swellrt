# SwellRT

SwellRT is a framework to develop quickly real-time applications in JavaScript, Android or Java. It provides following assets:

* Server app providing **real-time storage** with federation support.
* Reactive Client API to manage **real-time data objects**. Available client libraries for JavaScript, Android and Java.

SwellRT is suitable for **real-time collaboration**:  different users can read and edit data objects at the same time on real-time.
Specially, rich-text objects are provided supporting **real-time text editing**.


## Real-time collaboration

Nowadays, online services like Google Drive, Google Docs, Etherpad... are well-known. They allow users to share and edit different types of documents on real-time concurrently.
These real-time collaboration services are very complex and hard to develop so currently there are few alternatives beyond the big players like Google.
SwellRT enables developers to build these kind of services avoiding to handle the hard stuff: real-time communications, concurrency, data storage, etc.

## Federation

SwellRT provides federated infrastructure: it allows applications and users from different SwellRT's servers to share objects and to collaborate together on them on real-time.
This feature enables apps to scale beyond a central infrastructure.
